          Back in 2022, I decided to try my hands at creating backend servers, after seeing a friend coding for the first time, I tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-foward to today, and I've had the privilege of building amazing softwares that lives in the web, I have also been able to share my skills with others on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kviraj722" className="no-underline font-[500] outline-none text-white duration-300 ease-in hover:text-blue-300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
